#### Challenge
Provide Insights to Management in Consumer Goods Domain

#### Domain
Consumer Goods | Function : Excecutive Management

#### Problem statement

- Atliq Hardware (imaginary company) is one of the leading computer hardware  producers in India and well expanded in other countries too.
- However, the management noticed that they do not get enough insights to make  quick and smart data-informed decisions.
- Hence, company decided to conduct a SQL challenge which will help them to understand the data.

#### Task :

1. Check [ad-hoc-requests.pdf](RAW_Files/ad-hoc-requests.pdf) - there are 10 ad hoc requests for which the business needs insights.
2. Need to run a SQL query to answer these requests. 
3. The target audience of this dashboard is top-level management - hence want to create a presentation to show the insights.
